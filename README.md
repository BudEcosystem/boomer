## Introduction ðŸŽ‰

We are open-sourcing one of our early experiments of pretraining with custom architecture and datasets. This 1.1B parameter model is pre-trained from scratch using a custom-curated dataset of 41B tokens. The model's architecture experiments contain the addition of flash attention and a higher intermediate dimension of the MLP layer. The dataset is a combination of wiki, stories, arxiv, math and code. The model is available on huggingface [Boomer1B](https://huggingface.co/budecosystem/boomer-1b)



## Getting Started on GitHub ðŸ’»

Ready to dive in? Here's how you can get started with our models on GitHub.

Install the necessary dependencies with the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Generate responses

Now that your model is fine-tuned, you're ready to generate responses. You can do this using our generate.py script, which runs inference from the Hugging Face model hub and inference on a specified input. Here's an example of usage:

```bash
python generate.py --base_model 'budecosystem/boomer-1b' --prompt="the president of India is"
```

### Fine-tuning ðŸŽ¯


It's time to upgrade the model by fine-tuning the model. You can do this using our provided finetune.py script. Here's an example command:

```bash
torchrun --nproc_per_node 4 train.py \
   --base_model budecosystem/boomer-1b \
   --data_path dataset.json \
   --output_dir output \
   --per_device_train_batch_size 2 \
   --gradient_accumulation_steps 2 \
   --num_train_epochs 1 \
   --learning_rate 2e-5 \
   --fp16 True \
   --logging_steps 10 \
   --deepspeed ds_config.json
```

## Model details

| Parameters  | Value  |
| :-------------  | :----: |
| n_layers        | 4     |
